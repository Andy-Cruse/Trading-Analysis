# Trading-Analysis

This project pulls previous day's stock time series and displays the open, high, low, close, volume, and date per minute interval. It then takes that data and writes it to a MySQL database.

This project is mostly for me to try out Python OOP by having seperate classes and various functions. I also wanted to get familiar with connecting Python to MySQL and writing queries. It was trickier in Python because it took me an hour to realize that I needed to add quotations around my strings to insert values into a table.

I may use some of this data at a later date to play around with Scikit Learn and try making some predictions. Expect a Jupyter Notebook for that if I ever get the time.
